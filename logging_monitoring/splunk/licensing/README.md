- **User Access**: Some licenses may limit the number of users or the types of features available to different user roles.
- **Feature Set**: Different licenses provide access to various features and capabilities, which should be matched to the organization’s needs.

## Licensing Enforcement
- **License Manager**: Splunk’s license manager ensures that the usage complies with the terms of the license. It tracks the daily indexing volume and triggers warnings if limits are approached or exceeded.
- **License Violations**: Exceeding the licensed data volume repeatedly can result in license violations, potentially limiting search capabilities until resolved.
